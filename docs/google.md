# How to get YouTube API keys

1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com
  * Get a Google account if you don't already have one.
2. Create a project.
  * You can use what ever you want for names and IDs. No one will see them other than Google, you, and whom ever you share access to this project.
3. Open the new project and click APIs and Auth, then APIs
4. Find the YouTube Data APIs v3, click it, then enable it.
5. Back to the sidebar, click Credentials.
6. Create a new Public API access key and pick Server key.
  * If you want, you can limit the number of IPs allowed to use the key. But since only you know it, you can just allow all of them by leaving it blank.
7. You now have your key! It will look something like this: `AIzaSyARAvXdKG61GI3pBRRoYyhDo2ej3fHUIbE`
  * Yes, that was a real key. No, you can't use it now, I've already killed it.
