# How to get Reddit API keys

1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/ to start
  * You should have a Reddit account by now, right?
  * You can do this on your own personal account or the bot's account.
2. Click `create app...`
  * May be labeled as `create another app...` if you already have one.
3. Pick a name, select script, and fill in a redirect url
  * You can just use `https://reddit.com` for the rediredt url
  * No need to fill in the description about url boxes, they are not needed.
5. Add the bot's account as a developer, if you were not logged into that account.
4. You have your keys and secrets! The key is the one under the name and type of app, and secret is labeled as such.
  * A key looks like `Xg8LSlH7P2Z4cQ` and the secret like so `S234ATpedxuBbQZQ-NmywW2fGZg`. No, you can't use these, even if I didn't delete the app.
